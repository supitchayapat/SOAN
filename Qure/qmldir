module Qure

# TODO uncoment when resolving parsing for qtCreator and use qmlplugindump to regenerate qure.qmltypes
# for the moment qmlplugindump doesn't generate the .qmltypes file for this module
# because it depends on materials that has
# no material.qmltypes file, and it's the reason why it's underlined in red in QtCreator
# typeinfo qure.qmltypes. When trying to generate materials .qmltypes file using qmldumpplugin there is some
# erros that need to be resolved. To see the related error : Tools>qml/js>run checks
